# Machine Learning Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project involves two main tasks: binary classification (Task A) and multi-class classification (Task B), each utilizing different datasets.

### File Descriptions
- `main.py`: The main script that runs both Task A and Task B, prints performance metrics, and generates plots for Task B's training process.
- `TaskA.py`: Handles the binary classification task using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. It involves data loading, preprocessing, model training (Random Forest), and evaluation.
- `TaskB.py`: Dedicated to the multi-class classification task using the PathMNIST dataset. It includes data processing, building, and training a deep learning model (likely a CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras.

### Required Packages
To run the code in this project, the following packages are required:
- `numpy`: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning algorithms, model evaluation metrics, and data preprocessing tools.
- `tensorflow` and `keras`: For building and training deep learning models.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization and generating plots.
- `os`: For handling file paths and directory structures.

## Running the Code
Ensure all required packages are installed. Execute `main.py` to run both tasks and view the results.
